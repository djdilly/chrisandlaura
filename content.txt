About Laura and Chris.

Where's the wedding?
We are getting married in Braxted Park

How do I get there?
Planes...
Essex is very well served by all London's major airports. Although the closest airport is London Stansted. There will be regular buses to Chelmsford directly from the Airport.
To fly from Northern Ireland, Chris recommends flying from Belfast International to London Stansted using Easyjet. There are several flights daily to suit everyones schedule.

Trains...
Witham has an excellent train connection from London Liverpool Street or London Stratford Stations. This service runs very regularly, and takes between 50 minutes and 60 minutes. Don't be late though...Laura won't wait on you.
WARNING Irish folk, Stand on the right of the escalators...Londoner's can be grouchy...

and automobiles...
Witham is on the A12, directly between Colchester and Chelmsford, so go to one of those Cities, head for the other down the A12, and stop half way...simples...or there are plenty of GPS apps and devices about...

Where can I stay?
The are plenty of hotels in Chelmsford and the surrounding area. We will be providing transport from the train station on the day of the wedding at 12.
The closest hotel to the train station is the Premier Inn Chelmsford.

What's to eat?
Not sure yet, but when we know, you can choose here.

Isn't Essex that place from the TV?
Well yea, but it there is so much more to Essex <hyperlink>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex</> than what your see on TV.
